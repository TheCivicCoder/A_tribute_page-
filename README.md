# A_tribute_page-
This is a tribute web page dedicated to FreeCodeCamp. I made this page as an assignment during my free "Responsive Web Design" course on FreeCodeCamp.
This page gives a very brief intro about our COSMOS. The piece is based on the cinematic representation of the book "Cosmos: A space time odyssey" with the same name. This book is written by Carl Sagan a wonderful scientist and human being who inspired hundreds if not thousand soul to explore about our vast mysterious and amazing universe. Hope you like it.
